* Goal
- To build an indigeneous cloud computing platform that will meet the needs of Virtual Labs regardless of its size, 
by being simple to implement and massively scalable.

* Why Erlang?
   - Light Weight Concurrency.
     + Creating a process = 500B! 
   - Hot Code Replacement.
     + No downtime!
   - Transparent Distribution.
     + Single Computer to Network for free!

* Why ErlStack?    
  - Container Virtualisation.
    + Isolates the guests, doesn't virtualise hardware
    + Kernel does process isolation and resource management
    + Lightweight and fast
  - Support for container virtualisation in cloud platforms: Limited.
    + Mostly support LXC, which is bested by OpenVZ. (Checkpointing, Live migration, Security)
  - Ease of installation and usage.
    + Fiendishly tricky installations
    + RA's working on Eucalyptus or OpenStack can attest to that! :P
  - Rapid Development and unstable features.

* Introducing.. YAWS!
  - Yet Another Web Server.
  - Written in Erlang, blazingly fast.
  - YAWS vs Apache
    + http://www.sics.se/~joe/apachevsyaws.html
    + Apache dies at 4000 parallel connections, YAWS holds strong.
    + Reason : Implementation of concurrency by the underlying OS.
    + Erlang and YAWS don't depend on OS's concurrency mechanisms, so don't suffer.
  - Platform Agnostic.
    + Linux, Windows, x86, x64
  
* Architecture of ErlStack
  <Material to come!>

* Issues Faced

** Erlang
   - First Functional Language for most of us
   - Paradigm Shock!
     + Variables don't change!
     + RIP Iteration
     + Syntax!
     + Not much of documentation
   - Version differences and problems.
** Project Management
   - And then there were three...
   - Constant Reassignment of work
   - Along came 'bazaar'
     + Almost always had conflicting codes
     + Lots of stepping on toes, refactoring
     + Used to git, stark differences in philosophy at some points
** Yaws
   - Ehtml : learning curve
     + Turned into an advantage later
